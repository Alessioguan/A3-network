# Multi-Threaded File and Shell Server

This project implements a multi-threaded server that simultaneously handles file operations and shell command execution for multiple clients. It uses C++ with POSIX threads and socket programming to support concurrent access.

## Features

- **Multi-threaded Server**: Handles multiple clients simultaneously using threads.
- **File Server**: Supports file operations like open, read, write, seek, and close.
- **Shell Server**: Executes shell commands from clients and returns the output.
- **Concurrency Control**: Implements reader-writer locks to ensure safe concurrent access to files.
- **Debug Mode**: Optional debug mode that delays and logs operations for easier tracing and troubleshooting.

## Dependencies

- C++ compiler (GCC recommended)
- POSIX-compliant system (Linux/Unix)
- `pthread` library

## Installation and Usage

### Compilation

To compile the server, use the following command:

```bash
g++ -o server server.cpp -lpthread
```

### Running the Server

You can run the server with various command-line arguments:

```bash
./server [-f <file_server_port>] [-s <shell_server_port>] [-t <max_threads>] [-D] [-v] [echo]
```

- `-f <file_server_port>`: Set the port number for the file server (default is 9001).
- `-s <shell_server_port>`: Set the port number for the shell server (default is 9002).
- `-t <max_threads>`: Set the maximum number of threads the server will use (default is 5).
- `-D`: Enable debug mode, which adds delays and prints debug information.
- `-v`: Enable verbose mode for additional output.
- `echo`: Automatically assign port numbers based on the user ID.

### Example Usage

```bash
./server -f 8001 -s 8002 -t 10 -D -v
```

This command starts the server with the file server on port 8001, the shell server on port 8002, a maximum of 10 threads, debug mode, and verbose output.

### Client Interaction

Clients can connect to the server and perform operations like:

- **Shell Server**: Send shell commands (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, etc.) and receive the output.
- **File Server**: Perform file operations like opening, reading, writing, seeking, and closing files.

### Sample Commands

Here are some examples of how a client might interact with the server:

- **Open a file**: `FOPEN filename`
- **Seek in a file**: `FSEEK identifier offset`
- **Read from a file**: `FREAD identifier length`
- **Write to a file**: `FWRITE identifier data`
- **Close a file**: `FCLOSE identifier`
- **Execute a shell command**: Any valid shell command string.

## Concurrency Control

The server uses a reader-writer lock mechanism to handle concurrent access to files. This ensures that multiple clients can read from a file simultaneously, but write operations are exclusive.

## Debugging

When debug mode is enabled (`-D` flag), the server introduces artificial delays in operations and logs each step to the console, which is useful for tracing execution and diagnosing issues.

## Future Enhancements

- **Authentication**: Adding user authentication for secure access.
- **Enhanced Logging**: More detailed logging for easier debugging and auditing.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing client requests across multiple servers for better scalability.
